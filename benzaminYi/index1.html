			<p class="summary">On April 29, 1992, the Los Angeles riots began with a gathering on Florence and Normandie where the police set a precedence that would recur throughout the coming days: they retreated. Sparked by the acquittal for the four officers involved in the Rodney King beating, and fueled by a growing distrust of the Korean-American community by the African-American community in Los Angeles after an incident a year prior when a Korean storeowner of Empire Liquor was essentially acquitted for the shooting and killing 15-year old Latisha Harlins, Los Angeles became a war zone with its targets set on Korean-American businesses. Over 2,000 of the 3,100 businesses looted or destroyed were owned by Korean-Americans. The police abandoned Angelenos to fend for themselves, which resulted in a surge of gun purchases by the Korean-American community to defend their businesses.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="summary">This graphic takes a look at the hour-by-hour rundown of the chaos and action taken as detailed by the Los Angeles Times&rsquo; 2002 article titled &ldquo;Charting the Hours of Chaos.&rdquo; The events have been aligned to the hour of the day it took place, while the day of the event has been mapped starting from the inner circle moving outwards to show the progression of days. The red circle indicates violence occuring over 24 hours with 12 hours representing one full cycle. Darker red means two 12-hour cycles.</p>

			<span class='tooltiptextRT'>Aaron Ratinoff, a 68-year-old white man, died Friday, May 1, 1992, in the 11600 block of Gateway Boulevard in Sawtelle.  Ratinoff was strangled by a supermarket produce manager in a dispute over corn husks.<br>
			Ratinoff would never have ended up at the Bob's Market on Gateway Boulevard in West Los Angeles if the store where he normally shopped had remained open during the riots. The produce manager apparently got angry when Ratinoff dropped some corn husks on the floor while shopping for vegetables, and the pair tussled.<br>
			Coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher said the criterion his office has used for riot-related deaths was simple: "Would this person have died at that particular time and that particular place if the riots had not occurred?"

			In October 1994, two Altadena teenagers, previously accused of the murder of Maronian, were given five years' probation on related charges. O'Dell Whitley Jr., 19, and Leonard Hampton, 18, were sentenced in Pasadena Superior Court for commercial burglary of an Arcadia sporting goods store and attempted robbery of a pedestrian.<br>
			The two originally were charged with a series of crimes that included the stabbing of Maronian.<br>
			In April 1993, Whitley and Hampton were found guilty of the lesser crimes. But a mistrial was declared on the murder charge when only four of the 12 jurors voted for conviction. The district attorney decided not to retry the two for murder.

			"There was no exchange of words, no confrontation -- just the shots fired," said LAPD Det. Rosemary Sanchez.<br>
			A suspect was arrested in the Miller slaying, but the district attorney's office decided that the witness' identification was too shaky.

			He was known as "Nine Lives."<br>
			Twice in the last five years, Martin had been a passenger in cars where the driver was killed.<br>
			Once, it was a late-night automobile crash. The other time a friend was shot in the head by masked gunmen. "The boy just fell into Howard's lap," recalls his sister, Wanda.<br>
			Martin's luck finally ran out three days after the verdicts in the King beating case. The father of three, who grew up only a couple of blocks from King, was killed by a stray bullet.<br>
			The incident began, police said, when two officers tried to disperse more than 150 party-goers at a Pasadena apartment complex but were greeted with rocks and bottles -- and gunshots.<br>
			Nearly 25 more officers arrived quickly, and 10 of them fired a total of 70 rounds at several assailants.<br>
			Martin, relatives said, was visiting friends at a nearby apartment when he stepped onto a balcony to look at what was going on. He was struck in the head by a police bullet that apparently ricocheted off the street, police said.<br>
			Martin's sister and other relatives said police should have shown more control over their gunfire. "They probably felt they were under attack," she said. "But that doesn't justify firing 70 rounds."</span>

			At first, Sharaf, a Granada Hills resident who emigrated from Jordan three years ago, was listed as a riot victim. Detectives now believe that he was drugged before he was set ablaze and that the fire may have been an attempt to make the slaying appear riot-related.<br>
			Police said that Sharaf, who was a photo lab technician, had been doused with a flammable substance and set afire.
