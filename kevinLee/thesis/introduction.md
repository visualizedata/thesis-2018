## Diversity in Film
---

OPENING CONTEXT: It's common to see a Westernized perspective of the world in Hollywood, from individual roles of people to the stories told.

PROBLEM: In doing so, the film industry lends itself to tropes not just by subverting inclusion of diversity in terms of quantity, but by reinforcing stereotypes and clich√©s of characters.

RESPONSE: It isn't just an issue of including more of certain races and ethnicities but an issue of putting forth more meaningful and high quality representations for a perspective that better reflects people at large.
