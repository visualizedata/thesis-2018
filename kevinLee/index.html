							<p>Advertising is everywhere and we can get overwhelmed by how much is out there. As a result, we may actively seek to avoid them. But when we watch movies, we don't often realize it can be directly embedded into what we're enjoying and even paying for. Of course, this isn't anything new and has been in practice for decades. It's now a growing multi-billion dollar industry that leverages a few fundamental concepts in its quest for your eyeballs.

							<!--Advertising is everywhere. But when we watch movies, we don't often realize it can be directly embedded into what we're enjoying. In fact, this isn't anything new and has been in practice for decades. There are a few reasons why product placement is an effective way for companies to get even more brand awareness.--></p>

									<h4>Part of the Story</h4>
									<p><span class="image left">

										Featured brands can be part of the storyline and given premium emphasis by progressing the plot or even as their own characters. Like our friend, Wilson.</p>

									<h4>Lending Credibility</h4>
									<p><span class="image right">
											<img src="images/willsmithconverse.gif">
										</span>
										Products can not only be shown but used by movie stars. This interaction can range from subtle nods to close-up usage of the product, implying trust and an assocation. Even background cameos help.</p>

				<div id="movieDesc" class="desc">
					<h5>Cars are a big deal</h5>
					<p>
						Vehicles is the dominant category among all movies with nearly eight hours versus clothing with nearly five. Though movies focusing primarily on car-related themes like the Cars, Transformers, and Fast & Furious franchises could be seen as skewing the data.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, even with those movies removed from the dataset, vehicles <em>are still</em> the top category but only by a minute ahead of clothing.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="genreDesc" class="desc">
					<h5>Action is where it's at</h5>
					<p>
						Action movies contain the biggest amount of product placement screentime, with over seven hours of promotional material compared to comedy in next place with only three hours.
					</p>
					<p>
						Although <a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/market/genres">adventure has more market share than action</a> during this period, action movies outnumber adventure in the data by 3 to 1.

						<!--Harry Potter accounts for most of the adventure genre in the data and its source material doesn't quite lend itself as easily to placements.-->
					</p>
						<!--<p>This isn't too surprising given that action genres account for the one of the largest portions of market share</a> in the industry. Adventure has even more market share overall but </p>-->
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="actorDesc" class="desc">
					<h5>Celebrity power not so powerful</h5>
					<p>
						You might assume that brand association with popular actors would be a more preferable way to present a product.</p>
						<p>Yet what we see here is that most time spent in product placements are either not associated (N/A) with anyone at all, or actually seen with on-set extras who have no particular celebrity status.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="ethnicityDesc" class="desc">
					<h5>#ProductsSoWhite</h5>
					<p>
						It's not so surprising that most product placements by screentime occur with White actors.
					</p>
					<p>But what struck me is that second and third place go to either no one at all (n/a) or people who weren't noticeable enough to be identifed (Unknown) &mdash; both before any other ethnicity makes the list. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="genderDesc" class="desc">
					<h5>Gender Gap</h5>
					<p>
						It's a similar story here as in Ethnicity. Males make up the biggest portion while no association at all (n/a) comes before Females.
					</p>
					<p>
						In other words, this could imply that if Hollywood can't get a Male star to associate with a product, it might prefer those products stand alone than have Female stars associate with them.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="strengthDesc" class="desc">
					<h5>How in-your-face is it?</h5>
					<p>
						In terms of how much an onscreen product is visible, Hollywood appears to agree with Wayne Campbell's point that making it too heavy-handed might be a mistake.
					</p>
					<p>
						Visibility at a "subtle" distance is right in the middle of the range. However, it can be more than the word implies. It includes products at the forefront of a scene but not quite hitting you over the head, which means it's still quite noticeable.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="ageDesc" class="desc">
	    			<h5>Clothes maketh the kid</h5>
					<p>
						This view looks at the data split up by typical age brackets used in the marketing industry. 
					</p>
					<p>The thing that jumped out at me the most is that kids and young adults between 1 and 24 are promoting clothing by a particularly large margin.  Hollywood really wants to dress your kids up.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="brandDesc" class="desc">
					<h5>So what's actually in these categories?</h5>
					<p>
						We can go beyond categories and see how they break down by brand. A few interesting things popped out.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The top few brands in Food & Drink are beer brands, with Budwiser as #1 both here and in Advertising.</li>
						<li>Glasses/Sunglasses are a huge part of the Clothing category.</li>
						<li>Bill O'Reilly gets more exposure than I might have assumed.</li>
						<li>Many of the top brands in Entertainment are ones directly associated with Toy Story 3 for good reason.</li>
						<li>The camera loves Apple.</li>
					</p>
				</div>
				<!--<div id="grossDesc" class="desc">
					<h5>Most movies</h5>
					<p>
						Domestic gross starts from about $100 million to over $525 million (Avatar was kind of big). It turns out that the longest onscreen product placements are in movies that grossed the lower half of that range.
					</p>
					<p>
						But this range actually includes over 70% of movies in the dataset. 
						This may go against a possible assumption that brands may want to be featured in movies that might have more of an audience or a better forecast of box office success.

								does it actually influence us? yes and no. there are research studies that show it does indeed influence us. and there are reports of sales and company stock going up due to product placement in movies like ET (reeses pieces), top gun and risky business (brand), or movie 3 (brand). For Iron Man, Burger King confirmed more foot traffic (link). But does that mean if I see The Rock driving a BMW that I'm guaranteed to go out and buy a BMW? Not necessarily, especially for big ticket items. However, I wouldn't have thought one way or another about BMW until I saw a celebrity I might like implicitly endorsing that brand. Brand awareness is a big deal and product placement isn't going anywhere.  In the meantime, viewer beware.

								So does this mean if you see The Rock wearing Ray-Ban aviators, drinking a Pepsi, ordering a Domino's Pizza on his iPhone hooked up to a Plantronics bluetooth headset while driving a BMW you'll want to go out and buy every single one of those things? Not exactly, but you might not have given any of those products a second thought if you hadn't seen a celebrity you like implicitly endorsing those brands.

								There are research studies <a href="https://stopad.io/blog/product-placement-marketing">showing the effectiveness of product placement</a> while others have cited only a <a href="http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/product-placement/98832/">marginal increase in brand recall</a>. However, it's generally agreed that it helps further brand awareness</a> that would otherwise <a href="https://gsmoore1.wordpress.com/2011/10/06/traditional-advertising-vs-product-placement/">be avoided</a>. 
							</p>
							<p>
								It's a <a href="<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/05/business/media/05screen.html">film industry staple</a>, helping <a href="<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/05/business/media/05screen.html">pad budgets</a> and cross-promotional tie-ins get the word out. For companies, there are <a href="http://brandsandfilms.com/2011/01/top-40-product-placements-of-all-time-10-1/">numerous examples</a> where it's <a href="<a href="https://asunow.asu.edu/content/ads-movies-bring-results-study-shows">paid off</a>, translating consumer awareness to actual financial success.

								<p>One thing's for certain: it works.</p>

								<!--does that mean if I see The Rock driving a BMW that I'm guaranteed to go out and buy a BMW? Not necessarily, especially for big ticket items. However, I wouldn't have thought one way or another about BMW until I saw a celebrity I might like implicitly endorsing that brand. Brand awareness is a big deal and product placement isn't going anywhere.  In the meantime, viewer beware.-->
