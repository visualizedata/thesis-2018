<p><strong><font size="7">Strength in Numbers: Mapping U.S. Naval Diplomacy, 2012-2018</font></strong><br>
    <br><br>Global seapower competition is intensifying. As China dredges up ≈3,200 acres of territory <i>ex nihilo</i> in the South China Sea and emplaces sea missiles astride the Philippine archipelago, and as Russia disperses its submarines more widely across the Mediterranean as it conducts simulated attack strafing runs against NATO vessels in the Baltic Sea, the Obama and Trump national security teams have faced increasingly intricate naval diplomacy and maritime security challenges in recent years.<br><br>With these shifts in mind, this thesis examines the overall patterns in U.S. naval diplomacy worldwide from 2012 to 2018, querying diplomatic tension in the STRATFOR dataset under both the Obama and Trump administrations and comparing them to vessel movements as well as freedom of navigation operations (FONOPS). In addition, this thesis examines the geostrategic impact of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s diplomatic pivot to Asia in 2011 and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta’s decision in 2012 to move 60% of the U.S. fleet to the Pacific, breaking with decades of a roughly even 50%-50% Atlantic-Pacific force posture.</p></section>

 NAVAL_DIPLOMACY_INDEX.CSV<br><br>
 Using publicly available data<br>
 from STRATFOR and other<br>
 sources, this study constructed<br>
 a global index of U.S. carrier<br>
 activity. The time series begins<br>
 in January 2012 and continues<br>
 through present-day (May 2018),<br>
 with reporting lagged by roughly<br>
 two weeks. No classified or<br>
 operationally-sensitive details<br>
 are contained in this page.<br>
 The picture that emerges is<br>
 a complex mosaic of key U.S.<br>
 interests changing over time.<br><br>
 Notable instances of U.S. naval<br>
 diplomacy include May 2014,<br>
 when the USS Bataan was<br>
 positioned off the coast of<br>
 Libya for contingency<br>
 operations; September 2017,<br>
 when the USS Kearsarge<br>
 conducted disaster relief<br>
 operations in the Caribbean<br>
 following Hurricanes Irma<br>
 and Maria; and March 2018,<br>
 when Vietnam welcomed the<br>
 USS Carl Vinson, marking<br>
 the first visit in over<br>
 40 years.<br>

<p><strong><font size="7">Increased Mediterranean Presence</font></strong><br><br>
In recent years, U.S. carrier activity in the Mediterranean has intensified, with more pronounced activity east of Suez (near Europe) than west, in the Middle East. With Russia dispersing its submarines more widely across the Mediterranean, "[c]arrier strike groups [like the <i>USS Harry S. Truman</i> and <i>USS Carl Vinson</i>, for instance, that would just transit through the Mediterranean at maximum speed to get to the Middle East are spending much more time in the Mediterranean, not only contributing to [Syria and Iraq overflights in] <i>Inherent Resolve</i>, but also working the Russian presence problem in the Eastern Mediterranean, Black Sea," and other regions.

<p><strong><font size="7">7 U.S. FONOPs in 6 years</font></strong><br><br>
According to Adm. Philip Davidson -- the U.S. Pacific Commander -- “China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States.” In order to avoid that high-stakes scenario in Oceania, the U.S., Australia, and other regional allies in the ASEAN region have been conducting freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) in and around the South China Sea, directly challenging China's assertion of sovereignty and instead asserting the right for all ships to sail through the region.<br><br>
At the same time, it is worth remembering Secretary of Defense Robert Gates' warning that "if Chinese highly accurate cruise and ballistic missiles, anti-ship cruise and ballistic missiles, can keep our aircraft carriers behind the second island chain in the Pacific, you’ve got to think differently about how you’re going to use aircraft carriers."<br>
<br><br><strong><font size="5">Net result: <font color="#ffd400">&#9650; 83% increase</font> in U.S. naval activity in the South China Sea (SCS) in the most recent reporting period</font></strong></p></section>

<p><strong><font size="7">Future Challenges for the U.S.</font></strong><br><br>
<br><br>As global maritime traffic shifts, so too must U.S. naval strategy. In addition to massive physical commodity flows, there is also a virtual dimension to this highly globalized process in the form of accelerating Internet traffic, information, currency, and other financial exchange data flowing through the world’s sprawling network of subsea communications cables. Together, both are creating intriguing security targets for unscrupulous non-state actors who also use the oceans for piracy, contraband, modern-day slavery, and narcotrafficking, as well as for states which sometimes act in brazen disregard of public international law. Equally significant to this process is the ecological domain, where accelerated globalization -- or what Zygmunt Bauman calls “liquid modernity” -- is having a strong adverse impact on various forms of sea life.<br><br>
In order to understand these complex geostrategic dynamics, this study combines two distinct data sets: one on U.S. carrier movements and the other on diplomatic tensions worldwide, both unclassified and open-source in nature. Drawing from the prior net assessment literature within the public domain, it then examines spatial, programmatic, thematic, and chronological patterns in the aggregate data set, draws inferences as to how officials in Washington, DC define and protect the national interest, and presents conclusions as to the future of U.S. carrier diplomacy/naval aviation. When mapped at the most granular level, the scope and significance of freedom of navigation operations becomes more apparent.</p></section>
