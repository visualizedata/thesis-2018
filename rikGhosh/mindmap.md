## Visualizing the relationship between the human gut microbiome and disease
### Research Questions
#### Which particular bacteria are present in greater or lesser amounts in the presence of certain chronic diseases?
#### In what way does medication use affect bacterial presence (and even disease state, perhaps)?
#### Do certain foods influence the presence of particular bacteria? Which ones and for what bacteria?
### Data Sources
#### HMP: Human Microbiome Project
##### Data difficult to understand and in strange file formats
#### Individual PubMed papers
##### May have to compile data manually
#### Genova Diagnostics Microbiome Test Interpretive Guide
##### Would this be a tertiary source? Is it bad to get data from here?
## Visualizing how a culture's language influences its musical tradition
### Research Questions
#### What is the relationship between the particular words a culture uses to talk about music and the music it produces?
#### How many words does a culture have to talk about music, and does this influence the complexity of its music?
#### How does the sound of a language affect its music, both vocal and instrumental?
### Data Sources
#### Missing! I was drawn away from this topic because I'm not sure where I would find relevant data
## Visualizing nutrient content of US food supply through time
### Research Questions
#### To what extent has the nutrient content of US food decreased?
#### Why has there been a decrease in the nutrient content of food?
#### Has there been any adverse public health outcomes as a result of the shifting nutrient content?
### Data Sources
#### PubMed: papers on how public health has changed through years to show significance of changing food supply
#### USDA: Nutrient Content of the US Food Supply 1909-2010 
##### Very well organized dataset
