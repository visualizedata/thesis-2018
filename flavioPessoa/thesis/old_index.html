                    <h3>Motivations and purpose</h3>
                    <p>Teaching children how to code is a common goal in education in the US. Initiatives by the public and private sectors – such as code.org and CSforAll – are trying to address this with extensive funding and recommendations for courses and syllabi.</p>
                    <p>But the long-term objectives of such initiatives are not clear. Will they create better citzens and more informed students? Or are they focused on a more productive workforce? These different agendas need to be aligned with concrete paths for the children and also juxtaposed with their professional and lived experience.</p>
                    <p>Based on CSTA K 12 Computer Science Standards, and Github repositories as proxies for applied computer science, this visualization shows gaps and opportunities on both sides.</p>

                <!--<p>We see there&#39;s not much similarity. That can be partially explained by the fact tagging is driven by a need of creating indexes around specific content. This concept, derived from information science and library science, is crucial to creating hubs of discovery and knowledge. And when users of a digital network define those tags, it&#39;s been dubbed as folksonomy: the action of creating indexes done in a crowdsourced way.</p>-->
                <!--<p>So the data hasn&#39;t a clearer picture. A way to circumvent this is to pull all of the descriptions for each tag. Github provides us with this in their API.</p>-->

                <p>The relations are stronger and more understandable. To bind those two ideas together, we can now bind the Github topics to 5 categorical hubs in the K12 standard:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Computing Systems</li>
                <li>Networks and the Internet</li>
                <li>Data and Analysis</li>
                <li>Algorithms and Programming</li>
                <li>Impacts of Computing</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Using a <strong>parallel set technique, the path is clear:</strong> </p>
                <ol>
                <li>Pick one of the 5 categories</li>
                <li>See the topics related</li>
                <li>See the repositories related</li>
                </ol>
                <h5 id="toc_1">Repositories and topics relation with K12 categories</h5>
                <p><em>From top-to-bottom: K12 concepts, Github topics and Github top 500 repositories (by forking or starring)</em></p>

                <p>With interactive tools, it&#39;s also easier to specify certain thresholds and pick something up. Parallel sets help us with categorical data and their hierarchy and distribution on different levels</p>
                
                <h3 id="toc_0">The data</h3>

                    <h4 id="toc_1">CS Guidelines / <em>text data</em></h4>
                    
                    <p>CSTA (The Computer Science Teacher Association) was found in 2004 with a mission to support CS education for K-12 students in the US, and their counterparts around the world. </p>
                    
                    <p>In 2017, the association updated their latest guidelines of practices toward teaching and implementing CS classes. Divided in six groupings by age, there are <strong class='strong1'>120 standards</strong>, as they name them: we could just call them concepts. These are also <strong class='strong1'>grouped by 5 broader themes</strong>:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                    <li>Computing Systems</li>
                    <li>Networks and the Internet</li>
                    <li>Data and Analysis</li>
                    <li>Algorithms and Programming</li>
                    <li>Impacts of Computing</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>We took all of those standards, run a total count of when they appear, and also the rate of those appearances by the total number of words. Common stop words were removed from this collection of words.</p>
                    
                    <h4 id="toc_2">Github / <em>text data + meta-data (with quantitative and qualitative details)</em></h4>
                    
                    <p>Github is a social and web-based platform that has a variety of uses:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                    <li>Open-source distribution of software</li>
                    <li>Tool for managing version control of documents and projects</li>
                    <li>Hosting and publishing hub. </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>These uses also revolve around code-based projects, that are maintained by around 24 million users as of 2017. Code is organized in repositories, pages where you can upload your projects, update them and also interact with others.</p>
                    
                    <p>The interaction is crucial to Github. People can change things on other user&#39;s projects, copy and modify things for their own personal use and create a network of followers and following users. This is done in 2 major ways: forking, which is a copy of projects, and starring, where you can bookmark projects and people.</p>
                    
                    <p>Under the repositories, people can tag things, as a way of helping with the indexing of content on Github. <strong class='strong2'>We picked those tags (known as topics) for the most followed and forked repositories (the top 500 for each group), and the description given by the owner of each repository</strong>. </p>
                    
                    <h3 id="toc_3">Understanding the data</h3>
                    
                    <p>The initial reaction is to compare the frequency between the 2 datasets.  By using a <strong>word-cloud technique to see our results</strong>, it&#39;s easy to pick up patterns and commonalities.</p>
                
                <h3 id="toc_2">Specific patterns</h3>
