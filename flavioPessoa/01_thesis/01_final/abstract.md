#### The relationship between computer-science education and computational trends in Github

**Teaching children how to code is a common goal in education in the US. Initiatives by the public and private sectors – such as code.org and CSforAll – are trying to address this with extensive funding and recommendations for courses and syllabi.** 

*But the long-term objectives of such initiatives are not clear. Will they create better citzens and more informed students? Or are they focused on a more productive workforce? These different agendas need to be aligned with concrete paths for the children and also juxtaposed with their professional and lived experience.* 

Based on CSTA K 12 Computer Science Standards, and Github repositories as proxies for applied computer science, this visualization shows gaps and opportunities on both sides.

We will do a qualitative analysis between CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards and Github's most popular repositories. Those repositories act as proxies for pratical and applied computer-science knowledge, and will helpfully show the gaps and opportunities both sides could learn from.
