        <div class="stanzas">
        <p><span id="line01">I note the obvious differences </span><br>
        <span id="line02">in the human family.</span><br>
        <span id="line03">Some of us are serious,</span><br>
        <span id="line04">some thrive on comedy.</span></p>
        
        <p><span id="line06">Some declare their lives are lived</span><br>
        <span id="line07">as true profundity,</span><br>
        <span id="line08">and others claim they really live</span><br>
        <span id="line09">the real reality.</span></p>
        
        <p><span id="line11">The variety of our skin tones</span><br>
        <span id="line12">can confuse, bemuse, delight,</span><br>
        <span id="line13">brown and pink and beige and purple,</span><br>
        <span id="line14">tan and blue and white.</span></p>
        
        <p><span id="line16">I've sailed upon the seven seas</span><br>
        <span id="line17">and stopped in every land,</span><br>
        <span id="line18">I've seen the wonders of the world</span><br>
        <span id="line19">not yet one common man.</span></p>

        <p><span id="line21">I know ten thousand women</span><br>
        <span id="line22">called Jane and Mary Jane,</span><br>
        <span id="line23">but I've not seen any two</span><br>
        <span id="line24">who really were the same.</span></p>

        <p><span id="line26">Mirror twins are different</span><br>
        <span id="line27">although their features jibe,</span><br>
        <span id="line28">and lovers think quite different thoughts</span><br>
        <span id="line29">while lying side by side.</span></p>

        <p><span id="line31">We love and lose in China,</span><br>
        <span id="line32">we weep on England's moors,</span><br>
        <span id="line33">and laugh and moan in Guinea,</span><br>
        <span id="line34">and thrive on Spanish shores.</span></p>
        
        <p><span id="line36">We seek success in Finland</span><br>
        <span id="line37">are born and die in Maine.</span><br>
        <span id="line38">In minor ways we differ,</span><br>
        <span id="line39">in major we're the same.</span></p>

        <p><span id="line41">I note the obvious differences</span><br>
        <span id="line42"><span class="line11">between each sort and type,</span><br>
        <span id="line43"><span class="line11">but we are more alike, my friends,</span><br>
        <span id="line44"><span class="line11">than we are unalike.</span></p>

        <p><span id="line46">We are more alike, my friends,</span><br>
        <span id="line47">than we are unalike.</span></p>
        
        <p><span id="line49">We are more alike, my friends,</span><br>
        <span id="line50">than we are unalike.</span></p>
