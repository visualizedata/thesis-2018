        <p>I note the obvious differences <br>
        in the human family.<br>
        Some of us are serious,<br>
        some thrive on comedy.</p>
        
        <p>Some declare their lives are lived<br>
        as true profundity,<br>
        and others claim they really live<br>
        the real reality.</p></span>
        
        <div class= "borderEffect"><p>The variety of our skin tones<br>
        can confuse, bemuse, delight,<br>
        brown and pink and beige and purple,<br>
        tan and blue and white.</p></div>
        
        <span class = "lowerStanzas"><p>I've sailed upon the seven seas<br>
        and stopped in every land,<br>
        I've seen the wonders of the world<br>
        not yet one common man.</p>

        <p>I know ten thousand women<br>
        called Jane and Mary Jane,<br>
        but I've not seen any two<br>
        who really were the same.</p></span>

        <div class= "borderEffect"><p>Mirror twins are different<br>
        although their features jibe,<br>
        and lovers think quite different thoughts<br>
        while lying side by side.</p></div>

        <span class = "lowerStanzas"><p>We love and lose in China,<br>
        we weep on England's moors,<br>
        and laugh and moan in Guinea,<br>
        and thrive on Spanish shores.</p>
        
        <p>We seek success in Finland<br>
        are born and die in Maine.<br>
        In minor ways we differ,<br>
        in major we're the same.</p></span>
