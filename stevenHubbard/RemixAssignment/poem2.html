        <p>I note the obvious differences<br>
        in the human family.<br>
        Some of us are serious,<br>
        some thrive on comedy.</p>
        
        <p><div id="stanTwo">Some declare their lives are lived<br>
        as true profundity,<br>

        the real reality.</div></p>

        although their features jibe,<br>

        we weep on England's moors,<br>
