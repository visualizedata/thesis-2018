        <p id="line13">We are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike.</p>
      
         <p id="line12">We are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike.</p>
      
        <p id="line11">I note the obvious differences between each sort and type, but we are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike.</p>
        
        <p id="line10">In minor ways we differ, in major we're the same.</p>
       
        <p id="line09">We seek success in Finland are born and die in Maine.</p>
       
        <p id="line08">We love and lose in China, we weep on England's moors, and laugh and moan in Guinea, and thrive on Spanish shores.</p>
       
        <p id="line07">Mirror twins are different although their features jibe, and lovers think quite different thoughts while lying side by side.</p>
   
        <p id="line06">I know ten thousand women called Jane and Mary Jane, but I've not seen any two who really were the same.</p>
   
        <p id="line05">I've sailed upon the seven seas and stopped in every land, I've seen the wonders of the world not yet one common man.</p>
    
        <p id="line04">The variety of our skin tones can confuse, bemuse, delight, brown and pink and beige and purple, tan and blue and white.</p>
    
        <p id="line03">Some declare their lives are lived as true profundity, and others claim they really live the real reality.</p>
     
        <p id="line02">Some of us are serious, some thrive on comedy.</p>
    
        <p id="line01">I note the obvious differences in the human family.</p>
