        <div class="stanzas">
        <p class="stanza1">I note the obvious differences <br>
        in the <strong>human family</strong>.<br>
        Some of us are serious,<br>
        some thrive on comedy.</p>
        
        <p class="stanza2">Some declare their lives are lived<br>
        as true profundity,<br>
        and others claim they really live<br>
        the <strong>real reality</strong>.</p>
        
        <p class="stanza3">The variety of our skin tones<br>
        can <strong>confuse</strong>, <strong>bemuse</strong>, <strong>delight</strong>,<br>
        brown and pink and beige and purple,<br>
        tan and blue and white.</p>
        
        <p class="stanza4">I've sailed upon the seven seas<br>
        and stopped in every land,<br>
        I've seen the <strong>wonders of the world</strong><br>
        not yet one common man.</p>

        <p class="stanza5">I know <strong>ten thousand women</strong><br>
        called Jane and Mary Jane,<br>
        but I've not seen any two<br>
        who really were the same.</p>

        <p class="stanza6">Mirror twins are different<br>
        although their features jibe,<br>
        and <strong>lovers</strong> think quite different thoughts<br>
        while lying <strong>side by side</strong>.</p>

        <p class="stanza7">We love and lose in China,<br>
        we weep on England's moors,<br>
        and <strong>laugh</strong> and <strong>moan</strong> in Guinea,<br>
        and thrive on Spanish shores.</p>
        
        <p class="stanza8">We seek success in Finland,<br>
        are <strong>born</strong> and <strong>die</strong> in Maine.<br>
        In minor ways we differ,<br>
        in major we're the same.</p>

        <p class="stanza9">I note the obvious differences<br>
        between each sort and type,<br>
        but we are more alike, <strong>my friends</strong>,<br>
        than we are unalike.</p>

        <p class="stanza10">We are more <strong>alike</strong>, my friends,<br>
        than we are <strong>unalike</strong>.</p>
        
        <p class="stanza11">We are more alike, my friends,<br>
        than we are unalike.</p>
