### Using machine learning and datavisualization to analyze and interpret professional identity of secondary STEM teachers

### I. Introduction

### II. The Problem - An Overview
      A. How effective is using Natural Language Processing combined with data visualization as a method to anayze and interpret professional identity in secondary teachers

      B. What are the characteristics professional efficacy of STEM teachers participating in a teacher community based fellowship.


### III. Literature Review
      A. The problems facing teachers in STEM courses in the postsecondary education.
         1. Many (15-25%) leave the profession after 4-6 years.
         2. Salaries in STEM teaching are lower than if teachers didn't work in education.
         3. Education needs more STEM teachers.
         4. We are not getting the best STEM teachers because of lower salaries in public education.

      B. Identifying how others have tried to fix these problems.
         1. Professional deveopment
         2. Salary incentives
         3. Foundations that focus on both salary incentives and professional identity
  
      C. Professional identity in STEM teacher education
         1. Definitions of professional identity - concepts & theories
            a. profesional efficacy
            b. integrity
            c. professional community engagement
            d. reflection
            e. wellness
            f. critical thinking
            g. motivation
            h. confidence
         2. Studies on professional identity and its relation to retention of teachers
            a. outcomes of these studies
            b. methods used to measure professional identity
     
      D. Natural language processing as a method to conduct content analysis of text
         1. Benefits of natural language processing as a research method
            a. identifying patterns
            b. confirmation of what humans have coded
            c. logical approach to the text
         2. Limitations of natura language processing as a research method
            a. missing "emotion" of the story
            b. loss of story from the piece
            c. difficult to visualize
      E. Introducing the research question:  How effective is combining Natural Language Processing and data visualization methods as a means to analyze and interpret professional efficacy of STEM educators participating in a teacher community based fellowship?
         1. Definitions of the variables
         2. Statement on the purpose of this study
         3. Identifying key constituents of this study

### IV. Methods

        1. Non-profit organization in NYC that provides a fellowship
        2. Access to reflections written biannually
        3. Use of entrollment and engagement activities as a form of triangulation
        4. Provide information on Human Subjects Review - Exempt status
     
     B. Description of the methods used to clean the data set
        1. Combining/Cleaning the data set
        2. Storage
  
     C. Use of Machine Learning - Natural Language Processing
        1. Description of the natural language processing software used
        2. Outline of the procedures used to analyze the data
        3. List of variables and how they were treated
  
     D. Discussion of creating the visualizations of the data set
        1. Description of the software used
        2. Outline of the procedures used

     E. Overall review of the study

     A. Introducing the problem and procedures
  
     B. Results of natural language processing
        1. Common phrases/terms to describe the definition of professional identity
        2. Patterns identified by the content analysis
        3. Other quantitative results
           a. variables identified as influential in professional identity
           b. variables and their relationship to each other
        
     C. Results of comparing NLP results with quantitative engagement & workshop participation
        1. Overall results of engagement and workshop participation analysis
        2. Comparing the engagement results with natural language processing
        3. Determining if the triangulation of these two data sources was successful
  
     D. Visualizing the results
        1. Describing the process to determine the best visualizaiton method used to interpret the results
