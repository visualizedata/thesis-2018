*"Good teaching cannot be reduced to technique; good teaching comes from the identity and integrity of the teacher."*

Students perform better in the classroom when their teachers are proficient in the subject they teach, and they remain committed to the teaching profession.  However, studies in K-12 teacher retention demonstrate that between 15-25% of teachers leave the profession in the first 6 years of teaching.  In a recent study by Carver-Thomas and Darling-Hamond (2017), it is estimated that an urban school district can lose over $20,000 for each teacher who leaves.  Furthermore, a recent study from Sutcher, Darling-Hammond, and Carver-Thomas, found that teachers from the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines are more likely to leave than those from other fields in education. Teacher retention in K-12 education has important economic both nationally and on the local level.  This is especially true for the math and science disciplines, which are in need of a diverse workforce for future economic development.   

Researchers, educators, and policy makers have tried to find ways to improve teacher retention-especially in the science and math disciplines.  For instance, many studies demonstrate that salary enhances recruitment and encourages retention of math and science teachers.  However, there are studies that show concepts in professional identity (motivation, efficacy, integrity, wellness, etc.) play a significant role as well in teacher retention.  

The purpose of this study is to explore and visualize concepts of professional identity in math and science education to better help educators, educational administrators, educational non-profits, and policy makers create better solutions to teacher retention in the math and science disciplines.  The study approaches this phenomena in two parts. First, the study analyzes and interprets professional identity by using a data set from a science and math teaching fellowship program.  Second, the study will examine the effectiveness of using machine learning (Natural Language Processing) and data visualization methods as a means to analyze written reflections of early career secondary educators who STEM courses.   Teachers in this study are participants in a fellowship program that encourages professional development and engagement. The sponsoring non-profit organization collected four years of data used for this study.  For the analysis, the data set was de-identified, and it includes biannual reflections required by the non-profit organization, text from open ended questions on their original application, enrollment rates in professional development workshops, engagement in professional activities, professional recognitions, program withdraw records, courses taught, gender, and race/ethnicity.  

To analyze the teacher reflections in this study, I used natural language processing to identify patterns in the text and sentiment analysis to identify professional efficacy attributes (e.g., engagement, teaching motivation, locus of control).  In addition, I analyzed quantified participation and workshop enrollment rates to create a triangulation technique to help measure the effectiveness of the machine learning text analysis.  Data visualization methods were also used to help analyze the data and help interpret the journey of professional efficacy for early career STEM postsecondary teachers.

This thesis is structured to first highlight the problem of teacher retention in science and math education and how its related to professional identity by reviewing the literature in teacher education and professional development.  The study will next explore the data set and the methods used to conduct the analysis and create the visualizations for this study.  Finally, the study will review the results of the analysis and visualization and discuss the implications of the study findings on professional development and identity in science and math K-12 education.
