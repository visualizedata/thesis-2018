#Exploring Agriculture and Education in Sub Saharan Africa 

Agriculture has become an industry heavily reliant on science and technology.  This data visualization tool explores the relationship between education and agriculture in Sub Saharan Africa by comparing <i>agriculture value added per worker</i> (a measure of agriculture productivity) with three educational measures: <i>expected years of school</i>, <i>mean years of school</i>, and the <i>difference between expected and mean years of school</i>.

##Variables

Expected Years of Schooling:  The number years of schooling that a child of school entrance age can expect to receive if prevailing patterns of age-specific enrolment rates persist throughout life.
Mean Years of Schooling:  Average number of years of education received by people ages 25 and older, converted from educational attainment levels using official durations of each level.
Difference between Expected and Mean Years of Schooling:  Substraction of mean years from expected years of schooling
Agriculture Value Added per Worker:  A measure of agricultural productivity. Value added in agriculture measures the output of the agriculture sector less the value of intermediate inputs.
Gross National Income per Capita:  The dollar value of a country's final income in a year, divided by its population.
