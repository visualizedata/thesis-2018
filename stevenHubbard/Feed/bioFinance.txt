In my current position I work in the Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering's largest clinical department (about 1,200 employees including 350 physicians). I have a staff of four Departmental Fund Managers who work on reconciling physician funded bases, or the amount of their salaries they commit to funding via research each year (NIH/NCI and other grants, industrial contracts, philanthropy), research study assistant funding and other clinical trials office financial issues.

I'm also responsible for the department's multi-million dollar operating budget, budgeting for 34 hospital services in five divisions (Solid Tumor Oncology, Hematologic Oncology, Network Medicine Services, General Medicine and Survivorship & Supportive Care), plus Dermatology.

One of the most important tasks that I perform each year is professional salary planning (how much physician compensation will be paid for off of the hospital operating budget, from grants & contracts and physician practice plan earnings). Six years ago I, along with my Chairman and Administrator, created a series of bubble charts showing clinical productivity, compensation and research productivity (research expenses and protocol accruals) by physician, service and Division, all compared with national compensation and productivity benchmarks, resulting in junior faculty starting salary increases. Since then I've added trend graphs for various productivity measures by physician, service and division. I've been asked by the hospital's Senior Vice President, another senior hospital administrator and another Departmental Chairman to share this methodology with other areas.

I also manage personnel paperwork, reports on physician billings, collections and clinical activity and is involved in physician practice coding issues.
