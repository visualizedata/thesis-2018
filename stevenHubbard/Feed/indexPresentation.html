Although my work is highly fulfilling, it did not allow me the the kind of flexibility I was looking for, especially with my own family. That is where my journey as an entrepreneur began. As I soon learned, the next avenue I was taking was providing me with the time freedom and flexibility I so desperately needed. I have since been spending my time educating people on award winning products, and building and training a team of professionals to create their own home based businesses. As an Educator, I still have the constant fulfillment of being able to help people. This path has allowed me to help more people without restrictions, to work my own business around my own family, and to lead and be a part of a team of motivated and inspiring individuals who want to be a part of an opportunity with flexibility and endless possibilities.</p>
