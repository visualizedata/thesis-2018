<div class='biobox'><p>One of the most important tasks that I perform each year is professional salary planning (how much physician compensation will be paid for off of the hospital operating <span>budget</span>, from grants & contracts and physician practice plan earnings). Six years ago I, along with my Chairman and Administrator, created a series of bubble charts showing clinical productivity, compensation and research productivity (research expenses and protocol accruals) by physician, service and Division, all compared with national compensation and productivity benchmarks, resulting in junior faculty starting salary increases. Since then I've added trend graphs for various productivity measures by physician, service and division. I've been asked by the hospital's Senior Vice President, another senior hospital administrator and another Departmental Chairman to share this methodology with other areas.
