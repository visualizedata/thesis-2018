[Gender Differences in Sub-Saharan Africa](https://indexTuesdayFinal.html)

### Abstract
This project explores the differences between the expected years of schooling and the mean years of schooling based on gender from 2013 (UNDP). Africa has seen an increase in the number of school children gaining access to school.  However, there still seems to be a gap based on differences.   This data visualization project explores these differences.  From the "Income Inequality Trends in sub-Saharan Africa" report, we know that sub-Saharan Africa has experienced advancement in human development.  However, the report also highlighted gender inequality and differences in human development based on gender.  Since education is a factor in both calculating the Human Development Index, this data visualization project explores those differences by looking at differences in “expected years of schooling” and “mean years of schooling” by both male and female identified students.  Expected years of schooling is defined as “number of years of schooling that a child of school entrance age can expect to receive if prevailing patterns of age-specific enrolment rates persist throughout the child’s life” (Unesco).  Mean years of schooling is calculated by averaging the number of years of school accomplished by individuals 25 years or over.
